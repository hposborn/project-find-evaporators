    "The cause of the signal in evaporator transits is not the planet, but the dust cloud.\n",
    "\n",
    "To me, this dust cloud has three possibilities:\n",
    " * Spherical cloud around planet which decreases density with distance\n",
    " * Smeared tail behind planet which decreases density with distance\n",
    " * Smeared tail in front of planet which decreases density with distance\n",

    "* the direction of motion of the dust cloud w.r.t. the planet (+ being leading, 0 being sphere, - being trailing)\n",

    "In the previous models (e.g. with Kepler), they have included a term to model the effect that this tail of dust is actually *scattering* (ie not just blocking) the light. That means less light in transit, but also extra light around transit due to the fact that the tail is directing light back to the observer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Personally I think this is too much to include in the model because: \n",
    "* 3D reflection geometry is non-trivial\n",

    "* The amount of scattering will certainly be less with TESS because of the redder wavelength\n",
