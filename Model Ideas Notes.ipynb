    " * Smeared tail behind planet which decreases density with distance\n",
    " * Smeared tail in front of planet which decreases density with distance\n",

    "In the previous models (e.g. with Kepler), they have included a term to model the effect that this tail of dust is actually *scattering* (ie not just blocking) the light. That means less light in transit, but also extra light around transit due to the fact that the tail is directing light back to the observer.\n",

    "* 3D reflection geometry is non-trivial\n",
    "* It depends on both dust grain size & separation - two unknowns\n",
    "* The amount of scattering will certainly be less with TESS because of the redder wavelength\n",
